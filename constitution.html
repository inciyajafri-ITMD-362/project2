      <h1>International Society for Universal Dialogue</h1>
      <h2>Constitution & Journal</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Constitution of the ISUD</h3>
        <p class="intro">We the Members of the International Society for Universal Dialogue, in order to investigate and
          articulate the basic principles of universality systematically, rationally, and comprehensively—working to 
          promote a world-wide understanding of these principles, striving to help generate universal world-consciousness 
          towards the gradual emergence of a decent world order, and aspiring to actualize the highest and richest human 
          values in art, science, politics, education, and social life—do agree to declare the following statement as the 
          constitution of the International Society for Universal Dialogue.</p>
        <h4>Article I</h4>
        <p class="intro">The official name of the society shall be “The International Society for Universal Dialogue” 
            to be incorporated in the state of Maine, USA.</p>
        <h4>Article II</h4>
        <p class="intro">Scholars, especially philosophers, from all the countries of the world without exception, are
          entitled to membership in the Society without any discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, 
          nationality, religion, sexual preference, or social class. The democratic way of thinking and acting shall 
          be the guiding principle of all decisions which determine the plans and projects of the Society.</p>
        <h4>Article III</h4>
        <p class="intro">The ISUD acknowledges that it was the idea of Universalism that gathered the Society together
          in Warsaw in November, 1989; and further acknowledges and honors its close relationship with the publication
          Dialogue and Universalism which provides a forum in which all members of ISUD have the opportunity to communicate
          and exchange their views.</p>
        <h4>Article IV</h4>
        <div class="article">
          <ol>
           <li>The main purpose of the Society is to promote, in theory and in practice, the ideals of universality as the 
             most effective means for the gradual realization of a decent, peaceful, and just world order. To achieve this 
             purpose, the members of ISUD shall try—by means of scholarly work, regional and international conferences,
             as well as personal and collective work —to explore and share important areas of human knowledge and experience.</li>
           <li>More specifically, the purpose of the Society is to evoke and invigorate a global consciousness; that is, the 
             existential awareness that all the peoples of the world belong to one species, the human species, and accordingly 
             have the same fundamental stock of needs, aspirations, and capacities. This involves the recognition that these needs, 
             aspirations, and capacities cannot be adequately realized under conditions of selfish competition, violence, and
             exploitation but under conditions of peace, cooperation, and freedom. It also involves recognition of the responsibility
             to other species, and to the preservation and restoration of the health and beauty of all eco-systems on the planet.</li>
          </ol>

        <h4>Article V</h4>
        <div class="article">
          <ol>
           <li>The Society shall be administered by a body of governors called the Board of the International Society of 
             Universal Dialogue (ISUD); and it shall operate in concert with this Constitution, and with the decisions
             made by the ISUD General Assembly that meets prior to the tenure of a new Board..</li>
           <li>The Board includes an executive committee composed of four officers: Chair, Vice Chair, Secretary, 
             and Treasurer; and it also includes a body of other members that number no fewer than six and no more 
             than twelve. (So the full Board shall be no fewer than ten and no more than sixteen, including officers.) 
             Board members are elected for one cycle (normally two years) to serve in a particular Board position, and 
             have the possibility of being re-elected to one additional term in the same position. However, there must be
             at least one intervening cycle for a Board member to be reelected another time for the same position.</li>
            <li></li>
